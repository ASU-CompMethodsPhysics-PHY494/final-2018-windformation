Formation of Wind
Kacey Clark, Christian Burgoyne
Wind in simple terms is the movement of air. Often, this movement is caused by temperature differences in the atmosphere due to solar heating. In order to model this interaction, parameters such as humidity and pressure were analyzed as were their interferences with themselves over space and time. Large arrays of these values were utilized to simulate the movement of the humidity and pressure levels in three dimensional space. It was successfully demonstrated how slight variations in atmospheric pressure can form wind. Tornadoes are formed when two regions of air, one hot and one cold, meet and create violent funnels of wind. While the objective of simulating this phenomenon was initialized, it was ultimately left for potential future development. Knowing how these initial conditions can lead to large-scale phenomena can aid in the predicting and preparation for natural disasters like tornadoes.
